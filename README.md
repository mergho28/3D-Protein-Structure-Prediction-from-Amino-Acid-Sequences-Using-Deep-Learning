# 3D Protein Structure Prediction from Amino Acid Sequences Using Deep Learning
This code demonstrates a deep learning-based approach to predict the 3D structure of a protein using its amino acid sequence. It maps one-letter amino acid codes to their full names and encodes each amino acid as a numeric vector. The neural network model is designed using TensorFlow and consists of multiple dense layers to predict 3D coordinates (x, y, z) for each amino acid in the sequence. By training on synthetic data, the model attempts to capture relationships between the sequence of amino acids and their corresponding 3D positions. After training, the predicted 3D coordinates are visualized using Matplotlib in a 3D plot where each amino acid is represented as a sphere and labeled with its one-letter code. Additionally, a color legend with full amino acid names enhances the visualization, making it easy to interpret the structure.

The code utilizes several libraries: NumPy for handling numerical data, TensorFlow for building and training the neural network model, and Matplotlib for 3D visualization. The neural network is trained using a mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer. The visualization of the predicted 3D structure includes customizations such as different colors for each amino acid and a line connecting the amino acids, representing the protein's overall structure. With these tools, the code provides a simple but effective demonstration of how machine learning can be applied to bioinformatics tasks such as protein structure prediction.
